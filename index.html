      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm an aspiring full stack developer currently enrolled in Rutgers' Coding Bootcamp. I graduated from Rutgers with a double major in IT and Psychology in 2015. I've had a passion for web design and development since being introduced to it in an Intro to Computer Science class in high school. I worked as a Web Coordinator at Porcelanosa, a luxury European kitchen, tile and bath firm, for three years. I was part of the marketing department and worked on national campaigns along with updating and maintaining the corporate website. During my time there, I had the chance to work directly with developers who helped make major updates to the corporate site - including making the website ADA compliant, streamlining the mass import of hundreds of products, and updating the WordPress/Magento platforms to the latest versions. I realized that instead of managing projects, I wanted to be a developer myself.

      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Quito, Ecuador. I've been living in the U.S. for 22 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing video games, listening to music, meditation, yoga, and taking the occasional spontaneous trip to a new location.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is that of a full stack developer and web designer.  </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Newark, NJ.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to have a career where I can work on different projects and tasks instead of having only one responsibility, and being a web developer can make this possible. I enjoy a challenge (which is something that developers encounter when there are bugs that need to be fixed) and love the fact that this is an ever-changing field where there is always room to grow and learn something new.</p>
